# Daily Log Entry
## March 11, 2025

**Tasks:**
1. Update VM as usual.
2. Relational database exercises from textbook/lecture

**Notes:** `MySQL` continues to be a fun thing to practice in. As I will say in the discussion this week,
I think Excel or a similar spreadsheet (or even Access/databases) may be easier to create, but
`MySQL` is far superior in actually manipulating the data themselves and performing analyses of the data.
This will be a tool I need to dive into more and remember for the future.

**To Remember:**
1. `*` is a wildcard symbol
2. `order by ____ asc` and `order by ____ desc`
3. Group new strings for entries in parentheses
4. `boolean` to create a `TRUE/FALSE` entry
5. Use `as` to rename column in output
