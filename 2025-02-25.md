# Daily Log Entry
## February 25, 2025

**Daily Tasks**
1. Updated machine (usual commands)
2. Installed `apache2`
3. Used `systemctl status` to check that apache2 was enabled and active
4. Installed `w3m`
5. Checked default page using `w3m localhost`
6. Renamed default **index.html** file and created new **index.html** with `mv`
7. Edited **index.html** to be a new *Hello, World!*-esque webpage.

**Notes**
This was both easy and fun! It's been a while since I've worked in HTML/CSS, and I need to brush up
before I do a lot with my new server. With that said, it seems I still remember the basics.
