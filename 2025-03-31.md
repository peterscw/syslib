**Tasks Accomplished:**
1. Created cataloging module to go with OPAC
2. Tested module
3. Added new records to module
4. Searched added records in `MySQL`

**Notes:** More `PHP` syntax is becoming recognizable or at least decipherable. Making progress there.
Also beginning to remember more `MySQL` as practice continues there. I continue to enjoy seeing how
all the elements of our LAMP stack come together to create functional products, and while I can
appreciate just how much more would go into a functional OPAC/cataloging module for an actual ILS,
this is still good practice to see the beginnings of those applications.

**To Remember:**
1. `/var/www/html/cataloging` for cataloging module pages
2. `chown` for changing ownership
3. `chmod` for changing `setgid`, etc.
