# Daily Log Entry
## 11 February 2025

Daily Tasks accomplished:
1. Practiced with installing and removing software along with video (tldr)
2. Installed yaz
3. Practiced with yaz along with library search video
4. Independent practice with yaz, json/jq, and xml with LOC catalog

Notes:
yaz is going to be something fun to play with, I think. I enjoy MARC records/cataloging in general,
and being able to manipulate that data from a library's catalog was definitely fun. I can see quite
a bit of utility here, even if it might not be used widely by catalogers, etc. As the textbook notes,
this could easily be integrated into a GUI OPAC or ILS in order to provide bibliographic records
for the system. 

I will need to take time to learn this a bit more on my own, but so far, I'm having fun!
