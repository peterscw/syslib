# Daily Log Entry
## March 25, 2025

**Tasks Accomplished:**
1. Updated machine
2. Created `mylibrary.html` and `search.php` along with lecture/textbook
3. Added records to `opacdb` in `MySQL`

**Notes:**
Coding is still fun, but it took too long to figure out the syntax error in my `search.php`
even after `sudo php -f /var/www/html/search.php` told me the line and the error. 
With that said, at least the error was fixed, and my baby OPAC was up and running!

**To Remember:**
1. To switch to new database: `use _____;`
2. `insert into ____`
3. Please stop putting the comma inside the single quote when adding values. This is not English class.
