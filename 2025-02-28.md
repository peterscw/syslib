**Tasks:**
1. Examine PHP code in `index.php` and try to figure out more syntax, etc.
2. Opened `localhost` with `w3m` just to see what happens.

**Notes:** For the record, `w3m` registers as "Unknown OS" and "Unknown Browser" in my detector page. I thought it might pop up as Linux, at least, but apparently not.
With that said, the detector built into `index.php` does work on a variety of OS's and browsers, so everything seems to be going well along those lines.
Beginning to get a better handle for the syntax of PHP even if I don't understand all the specific commands yet. Seems very similar to HTML, and I can appreciate how the two integrate nicely.
(`<>`, `</>`, and similar, for example)

Continuing to look forward to finishing the rest of the LAMP server!
