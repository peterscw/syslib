**Tasks:**
1. Install software for php
2. Use `systemctl` to restart Apache2 and check its status
3. Create backup of index.php via `cp` function
4. Write html/PHP to new index.php file.
5. Test new PHP/server index page on multiple devices/browsers

**Notes:**
Continuing to regain my grasp of html, but PHP is new. I think I've figured out the basic syntax
of what we used (`elseif`, `$user_agent`, `!==`, etc.) but want more practice with it.
I made a couple of dumb mistakes while typing up the code (spaces matter, and so do closing brackets).
In the end, though, the page was up and functioning as it should be. Must remember the new directories
of `/var/www/html/` (working pages) and `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/` (config files).
