Today's Tasks on VM:
1. Updates
2. Practice using grep with scopus.bib

Attempted to do as much as possible from memory without reference to book. Moderately successful!
Definitely improving with grep, and see utility of command.

Have gotten better at using nano and creating new files as well.

Getting comfortable with Git commands to update repo.
