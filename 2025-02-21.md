# Daily Log Entry
## 21 February 2025

**Tasks for Today:**
1. Run updates on VM (using `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y`)
2. Check current disk space (using `df`). Disk space 55% used.
3. Experiment/refresh with `yaz`
4. Reviewed searching with `grep`
5. Ran commands to complete mini-portfolio for module 3

**Notes:**
`yaz` continues to be a lot of fun. I used `ping` and `nslookup` to try to get information about
my local library, and while it gave me basics, I still couldn't quite get `yaz` to connect.
Interestingly, it told me the name of the ILS they use when it connected as much as it did,
but no records were ever returned for any search I ran. Not sure if the catalog isn't built on 
MARC21 (even though those records are publicly available on their website) or what the issue was.

Regardless, read Polaris ILS documentation and still could not identify issue.

`grep` also continues to get more familiar/comfortable. I do wonder about the overall utility
of searching in a CLI vs GUI when working with large sets of data. Will continue to practice
and explore there.

For Module 3 Mini-Portfolio, I went back and used the `apt` commands to `search` and `show` 
`tree` then `install` it. All goes well with the basics!
