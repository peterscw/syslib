# Daily Log Entry
## March 4, 2025

**Tasks Completed:**
1. Updated machine as usual
2. Installed `mysql-server`
3. Configured `mysql` security policies
4. Created user/pass for `mysql` server as well as new database and table (`create` commands)
5. Completed database queries from lecture/book (`select`, `alter`, 'delete`, `inssert`, `describe`)
6. Wrote PHP to provide access to `opac.db` on Apache2 server

**Notes:** This was a really fun week! MySQL looks like it will be a fun tool to use for web-based
databases, and creating the database and tables was pretty straightforward and easy. I'm sure queries, 
etc. will get more advanced/difficult as we go, but for right now, this has been the easiest (and my
favorite) part of creating our LAMP stack. I did have two minor syntax errors in my `opac.php`, but
they were fixed easily (two missing spaces). I may experiment later with adding a link to the OPAC page
on my default `php` page so I can have easier access to it while checking things on my normal machine. 

**Things to Remember:**
1. Use `sudo php -f [directory and file]` to check syntax
2. `^_` in `nano` is your friend if `php -f` returns syntax errors.
3. `/var/www/html` for webpages created
4. `/var/www` for config files and other private/root-only `php` files
5. `;` at end of commands for `MySQL`
6. If errors in displaying webpages, check with `systemctl status` to ensure they're up active/enabled
