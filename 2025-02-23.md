# Daily Log Entry

**Tasks Accomplished:**
1. Checked for updates with usual `apt` commands (none)
2. Played around with `yaz` to explore other attribute codes

**Notes**
Located one record on UK's catalog using a command for `f @attr 1=4 "books"`. Used info from that record
to explore searches (`f @attr 1=_ "_"` format) for what might be in other fields. Discovered the `1=4`
covers all title-related fields, as some results didn't have the word in the 2XX fields, but did have
it in the 490, 830, etc. fields. At the very least, `1=4` covers title and series info/fields (or seems 
to).

By chance, discovered that `1=7` searches by ISBN. Could be useful in future if item is physically
available but need to pull its record.
